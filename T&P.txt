Abstraction is the process of showing the essential details while hiding the bg details 
It can be achived by two ways in java 
1. Interfaces 
2. Abstract class
An abstract class is a class declared with abstract keyword , it can have both abstract and non abstract methods
An abstract class is a way to archive Abstraction in OOPS
an abstract class cant be instiansiated 
it can have final methods 
it can have constructor and static methods 
An abstract class cant be declared final
ex : - abstract class A {
    abstract void xyz(){

    }
    final void abc(){

    }
}

//Abstact class
//nested class
Constructor 
//this and super
