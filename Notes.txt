#Abstract_Class
    Abstarct class it cant be instantiated (Object of that class cant be created )
    but we can inherit it and use dynamic method DISPATCH (like upcaasting )
    An abstract classes method is overrided in its child class (ifsubclass is not overriding that abstract method that class is also abstract class)
    It can have constructor and static methods 
    It can have feild and non abstract methods too
    In abstract class we can declare feild that are not static and final 
    Also we can declare public , protected and private method  

# Interface
    A Interface or Class can extend many interfaces using comma 
    If we dont specify the interfaces as public access modifier than we can only use that interface in same package 
    The interface body contains 
        Abstract methods
        Default method
        Static method
    While defining default method we have to use defaukt keyword


#Nested_Class
    A class within class is know as nested class 
    To call the object of nested class we haveto use a certain declartion Types
    Example
        class Gargi{
            .....
            class Abhishek{
                ........
            }
        }
        class main{
            Gargi.Abhishek ObjofAbhsiehk = Gargi.new Abhishek();
        }


#this_Keyword
    this keyword gives a refernce to the current object
